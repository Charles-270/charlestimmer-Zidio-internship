# Digit Recognition Project

This project implements a machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits from images. The project was built in Python using Jupyter Notebook and explores various stages of data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation to achieve accurate digit recognition. The aim is to create a model that can classify digits 0 through 9 with high accuracy.

## Project Overview

Handwritten digit recognition is a common example of image classification, often used to introduce concepts in computer vision and machine learning. This project likely employs a deep learning approach, utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of digits.

### Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes steps for data normalization and reshaping to prepare the dataset for model training.
- **Model Architecture**: Design and implementation of a CNN model suited for image classification.
- **Training and Evaluation**: The model is trained on a digit dataset, and performance is assessed using accuracy and other evaluation metrics.

## Requirements

To run this project, the following Python libraries are required:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `tensorflow` or `pytorch` (depending on the deep learning framework used)
- `sklearn`

These dependencies can be installed with:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow scikit-learn
```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Charles-270/digit-recognition.git
    cd digit-recognition
    ```

2. **Open the Notebook**:
   Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `Digit_Recognition Project.ipynb`.

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   Run each cell sequentially to load data, preprocess it, define the model architecture, train the model, and evaluate the results.

## Project Structure

- `Digit_Recognition Project.ipynb`: Main notebook file containing code and explanations for the digit recognition process.
- `data/`: Folder where the digit dataset is stored (e.g., MNIST dataset).
- `models/`: Folder where trained models are saved (optional).
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Results

The final model achieves high accuracy on the test set, demonstrating the ability to accurately classify handwritten digits. Detailed metrics and visualizations are included in the notebook.

## Future Work

Possible improvements and extensions for this project could include:
- Implementing data augmentation to improve model generalization.
- Experimenting with different model architectures to boost accuracy.
- Fine-tuning the model on additional digit datasets.
